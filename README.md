# Introduction
Latest advancement in AI technology and deep learning algorithms are changing the retail industry. With large number of
data sets comprising thousands of shelf images, companies can now leverage of AI to better monitor their retail shelf
presence. AI will help in recognizing product conditions on shelf such as availability, assortments, space, pricing,
promotions and many more. It will empower companies to take immediate corrective. AI algorithms provide accurate stock
visibility insights. In this project we present algorithms to detect and count the retail objects using Open CV and Deep
Learning techniques. The first step is to detect the objects and draw boundaries around them. The second step is to count
the boundaries to get a total count of the objects in the image.

## Methodology

We have adopted various images recognition techniques to achieve the retail object counting.
1. Tradition Open CV Techniques
  - Thresholding
  - Edge Detection
  - Background Removal
  - Contour Detection
2. Deep Learning Techniques
  - Faster RCNN
  - Multi-box Single Shot Detector (SSD)
